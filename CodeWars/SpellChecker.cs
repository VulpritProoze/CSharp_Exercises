/*
**	Task
**
**	Inputs: 
**	(1) A string representing a piece of text to be 
**	spellchecked. 
**	(2) A list or array of single words. These words 
**	are (assumed to be) correctly spelled. Any word in the text 
**	that is not in the list is a misspelling.
**
**	Output: A dictionary of all misspelled words, each with a list 
**	of possible corrections. The corrections for each misspelled 
**	word are the words in the list "nearest" to it, as defined in 
**	the "Details" section below.
**
**	Example: If text = "The students were thriled to recive ther 
**	diplomas.", and word_list = ["to", "the", "were", "there", 
**	"their", "recite", "receive", "students", "thrilled", "diplomas"], 
**	the spellchecker should return {"thriled": ["thrilled"], 
**	{"recive": ["receive", "recite"]}, {"ther": ["the", "their", "there"]}.
**
**	Although people can tell from context that "recive" should be 
**	replaced by "receive" rather than "recite", this simple 
**	spellchecker cannot. All it knows is that "receive" and "recite" 
**	are the words nearest to "recive" in the word-list. Similarly, 
**	"the","their"and "there"are the nearest words to "ther".
**
**	Details
**	(1) Each word in the word-list is a non-empty string containing 
**	lower-case letters. Any character besides the first and last can 
**	also be an apostrophe or hyphen. (Apostrophes and hyphens occur 
**	in English words, like "don't, "able-bodied".)
**
**	(2) Each word in the text is a non-empty string containing at 
**	least one letter. Any character besides the first and last can 
**	also be punctuation ("internal punctuation"). Internal punctuation 
**	that results in a misspelling should be corrected. There is at 
**	least 1 whitespace character between words.
**
**	(3) The corrections for each misspelled word are the words in the 
**	list within edit distance 1 of it. If there are none, its corrections 
**	are at edit distance 2. If there are also no corrections at edit 
**	distance 2, the list of corrections is the empty list. See the 
**	"Edit Distance" section below for the precise definition of edit 
**	distance 1 and 2.
**
**	(4) Each word in the word-list is lowercase, but corrections 
**	should take case into account. Characters in a misspelled word 
**	that are in the correct position preserve their case. Incorrect 
**	characters should be corrected to be lowercase, unless the 
**	misspelled word is entirely uppercase (i.e. all letters are uppercase 
**	- the case of internal punctuation is irrelevant) and of length > 1. 
**	For strings of length 1, keep the case of the first character, 
**	whether correct or not.
**
**	Example: If text = "We CANOT belieVe 'Th$IS'. E woNT'!! and
**	word_list = ["we", "can't", "this", "well", "won't", "cannot", 
**	"believe"],
**	the checker should return {"CANOT": ["CAN'T", "CANNOT"], "Th$IS": 
**	["This"], "E": ["We"], "woNT": ["woN't"]}.
**
**	Explanation:
**
**	"CANOT" is a misspelling of "can't" or "cannot". It's an uppercase 
**	string of length greater than 1, so the corrections should be 
**	entirely uppercase: "CAN'T", "CANNOT".
**	"Th$IS" is a misspelling of "this". The first 2 letters are correct 
**	and preserve case. Both "$" and "I" are wrong, so should be corrected 
**	to the correct character in lowercase. The correction is "This".
**	"E" is a misspelling of "we". It's an uppercase string, but since 
**	it's length 1, we keep the case of the first character, but we don't 
**	know that the rest of the string should be uppercase. So the correction is 
**	"We" rather than "WE" or "we".woNT'!! deserves close attention. The misspelled 
**	word ends at 'T', because "'!!" is "external" punctuation. The ' is NOT part 
**	of the misspelling. The first 3 characters are correct and preserve case. 
**	The 'T' is wrong and is corrected to '. The correction is "woN't".
**
**	(5) Each list of corrections should be lexicographically sorted. This is 
**	why ["receive", "recite"] appears instead of ["recite", "receive"]in the 
**	first example.
**
**	(6) No duplicate strings should appear in any list of corrections.
**
**	Edit Distance
**	In this kata, the words whose edit distance is 1 from a given word are those 
**	that result from doing one of the following operations: deleting a single 
**	character, inserting a single character, replacing a single character by a 
**	different character, or transposing a pair of adjacent characters. Edit 
**	distance 2 refers to doing two of those operations. In this kata edit 
**	distance calculations ignore case.
**
**	Examples:
**
**	The following are at edit distance 1 from "hello":
**	"helo" (delete 'l')
**	"Heello" (insert 'e')
**	"helpo" (replace 'l' by 'p')
**	"hlelO" (transpose 'l' and 'e')
**
**	The following are at edit distance 2 from "hello":
**	"helP" (delete 'l', then replace 'o' with 'p')
**	"elhlo" (transpose 'h' and 'e', then transpose 'h' and 'l')
**	"MELLOW" (replace 'h' with 'm', then insert 'w')
**	"shelol" (insert 's', then transpose 'l' and 'o')
**
**	This corresponds to Damerau–Levenshtein Distance. It is NOT the same 
**	definition as used in the Levenshtein Distance kata.
**
**	Costraints: Number of words in the text ≤ 250. Number of words in the 
**	word-list ≤ 250.
**
**	Enjoy correctign yore speling!
